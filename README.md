# Laptop-Sales_Analysis

Introduction
In today's tech-driven world, laptops play a crucial role in work, education, and entertainment. With the global laptop market reaching $127.6 billion in 2023 and projected to grow substantially, understanding consumer preferences is essential for companies competing in this space. This project aims to analyze consumer laptop preferences, identifying top-selling models and the features most valued by users. By leveraging data analytics, we seek to provide actionable insights for manufacturers to better align with customer needs and improve their market positioning.

Objective
Our primary goal is to analyze a dataset on laptop sales to determine which models are most popular and identify key features that attract buyers. Additionally, weâ€™ll explore why certain models struggle, helping businesses make data-driven decisions to enhance product appeal and increase customer satisfaction.

This analysis is conducted using SAS for data processing and visualization. SAS enables efficient handling of large datasets and provides powerful visualization capabilities, allowing us to better understand and present our findings.

Methodology
Our approach includes:

Data Collection: Sourcing a dataset that includes specifications, sales numbers, and consumer ratings for laptops.
Data Processing and Analysis: Using SAS to filter and analyze key metrics.
Visualization: Creating graphical representations of sales and feature preferences.
Insights and Recommendations: Identifying top-performing models, exploring reasons for underperformance, and suggesting improvements for manufacturers.

Requirements
To replicate this project, you'll need the following:

SAS Software: Required for data analysis and visualization.
Dataset on Laptop Sales: Ensure the dataset includes details like model specifications, sales numbers, and consumer feedback.
Usage

To run the analysis:

Load the dataset into SAS.
Run the data processing and visualization scripts to generate insights.
Review the outputs, including sales trends, feature analysis, and consumer preferences.
Results and Insights
Our analysis will highlight:

The most popular laptop models and their key features.
Most popular OS and why.
And some questions of analysis like that.
